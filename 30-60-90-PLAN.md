# 30, 60, 90 Day Plan

First off, welcome to the team! We are all excited to have you. This guide will help depict what your first ~90 days with the company will look like. It aims to set expectations and provide initial steps so you can get up-and-running quickly and painlessly. At this point you likely have completed boot camp and are itching to begin development. Fair warning - it's likely going to take a solid quarter to figure this place out. Assimilating to a new software environment is not an easy accomplishment. Take your time, attend all the meetings and trainings, get to know your coworkers, and ask a lot of questions! We are here to help you get up-to-speed as quickly as possible.

> This is an evolving document. If anything is unclear or outdated, please make notes and update the document for those who will use it in the future.

The following is a general timeline to help you gauge how long different phases of ramp-up might take. It's okay to take more or less time here, as there are a number of factors that can influence the amount of time required. During this time, *your manager should schedule weekly one-on-ones with you* to help guide you on the right path.

| Time-frame  | Tasks  |
|---|---|
| Week 1  | Machine Setup + Start 3rd Party Tutorial  |
| Week 2  | Complete 3rd Party Tutorial + Start Internal Tutorial  |
| Week 3  | Internal Tutorial + Architecture Overview  |
| ~Weeks 4-10  | Individual Contributor Work + Continued Architecture Overview  |
| Happily Ever After | Team Contributions :) |

## Week 1

Week one! You probably have a few questions at this point. Questions about the company, our team processes, your individual responsibilities, etc. - not to mention the questions you don't even know to ask. The team and I expect you to have questions, so step one is to be curious! We are all happy to help clear up expectations, answer any questions, and help show you the ropes. Your manager will meet with you to start developing a working relationship and offer some dedicated time to answering some of these questions. You've likely met some fellow employees, but there are new faces around every corner. I'd encourage you to introduce yourself to other employees and to have a team member make the rounds to meet some of the people you will interact with on a regular basis.

Feeling settled in? Get your Star Wars action figures positioned correctly on your desk, customize your IDEs, and ensure your development machine is set up properly. It's important you feel comfortable and have the necessary setup to be productive. Let me know if there is anything you need in order to do your job most effectively. Once you're settled, we've prepared some tutorials to get your feet wet.

## Week 2

I'm guessing the first week went by quickly! You're likely dealing with information-overload, but keep soaking in as much knowledge as you can. Some of your team members will schedule time to talk about our code base and processes. We'll cover topics like our Object-Oriented Design, Atlassian workflow, CI/CD process, and more.

### GOALS

- [ ] Info Sessions with teammates
- [ ] Continue tutorials
- [ ] Keep asking lots of questions
- [ ] More team meetings
- [ ] Second 1:1 with manager
- [ ] Introduction to team's values
- [ ] Setup email filters

<details>
<summary>Info Session Topics</summary>

- [ ] Code Architecture
- [ ] JIRA and Bitbucket
- [ ] Ember Addons
- [ ] Sentry, Application Messages, and Coverity
- [ ] Databases and SSMS
- [ ] Dealer Site Tips & Tricks
</details>

## Week 3

The tutorials you've been working on are likely complete or nearing the wrap-up phase. From conversations with your teammates, you should now have a general understanding of our code base and processes. Now is a good time to try your hand at some smaller, bite-sized tickets.

You should be attending team meetings to get acclimated to the current projects being worked on. Teammates will find good introductory tickets to pass your way. Don't be discouraged if these easier tickets still take you a considerable amount of time. Learning how to access sites and applications can be time consuming. You will slowly speed up in your abilities over time. Knowing who task and where to find help is crucial here. Discuss with your manager different techniques and expectations regarding this topic.

If you can squeeze an extra task into your already busy schedule, I'd highly recommend you start looking at other team member's code reviews. Start gaining a feel for our code style and see what others are working on. There are no expectations of making technical suggestions, but think of this more as an opportunity to ask questions about the code and why certain decisions were made.

### GOALS

- [ ] Complete first ticket
- [ ] Gain understanding on current projects
- [ ] Continue Info Sessions with teammates
- [ ] Discuss where to find help
- [ ] Participate in a few code reviews

## Week 4

You've likely started work on your first tickets and are getting accustomed to our JIRA and Git workflows. At this point, I'd like for you to schedule some code shadowing or pair programming sessions with our team members. Seeing how other developers work will give you insight into tips and tricks that they have learned on the job. 

Regarding continued education, I encourage you to start thinking about how you would like to utilize your education budget. This might include books you'd like to read, online learning resources, in-person conferences, or school classes. 

### GOALS

- [ ] Set individual goals
- [ ] Continue bite-sized tickets
- [ ] Schedule code shadowing sessions
- [ ] Consider education budget opportunities
- [ ] More code review participation

## Weeks 5-10

The hope is that you are now acquainted enough with our processes and code base enough to continue individual contributions. Integrating tickets from your team's projects into your daily assignments will gradually allow you to begin contributing on a team project level.

As you continue to gain familiarity, I'd encourage you to schedule a trip to visit your other team members in person. There is not a required cadence in which you must visit the other offices, but I would suggest going once or twice a year to help develop trust and relationships with your team members.

- [ ] Plan trip to visit rest of team in person.
- [ ] Contribute to sub-team program
