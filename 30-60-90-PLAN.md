# 30, 60, 90 Day Plan

First off, welcome to the team! We are all excited to have you. This guide will help depict what your first ~90 days with the company will look like. It aims to set expectations and provide initial steps so you can get up-and-running quickly and painlessly. At this point you likely have completed bootcamp and are itching to begin development. Fair warning - it's likely going to take a solid quarter to figure this place out. Assimilating to a new software environment is not an easy accomplishment. Take your time, attend all the meetings and trainings, get to know your coworkers, and ask a lot of questions! We are here to help you get up-to-speed as quickly as possible.

> This is an evolving document. If anything is unclear or outdated, please make notes and update the document for those who will use it in the future.

The following is a general timeline to help you gauge how long different phases of ramp-up might take. It's okay to take more or less time here, as there are a number of factors that can influence the amount of time required. During this time, *your manager should schedule weekly one-on-ones with you* to help guide you on the right path.

## Week 1

Week one! You probably have a few questions at this point. Questions about the company, our team processes, your individual responsibilities, etc. - not to mention the questions you don't even know to ask. The team and I expect you to have questions, so step one is to be curious! We are all happy to help clear up expectations, answer any questions, and help show you the ropes. Your manager will meet with you to start developing a working relationship and offer some dedicated time to answering some of these questions. You've likely met some fellow employees, but there are new faces around every corner. I'd encourage you to introduce yourself to other employees and to have a team member make the rounds to meet some of the people you will interact with on a regular basis.

Feeling settled in? Get your Star Wars action figures positioned correctly on your desk, customize your IDEs, and ensure your development machine is set up properly. It's important you feel comfortable and have the necessary setup to be productive. Let me know if there is anything you need in order to do your job most effectively. Once you're settled, we've prepared some tutorials to get your feet wet.

## Week 2

I'm guessing the first week went by quickly! You're likely on information-overload, but keep soaking in as much knowledge as you can. Some of your team members will schedule time to talk about our code base and processes. We'll cover topics like our Object-Oriented Design, Atlassian workflow, CI/CD process, and more.
