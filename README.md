# Manager README

I'm excited to get to know you organically through frequent conversations, but here are a few up-front details about my philosophies that should be helpful in the meantime. Inspired by [this article](https://hackernoon.com/12-manager-readmes-from-silicon-valleys-top-tech-companies-26588a660afe), this guide is intended to set expectations for our working relationship. It aims to do two very specific things:

1. Reduce any anxiety or uncertainty with your new role.
1. Provide insight into my role and how I operate, in order to help us foster a meaningful relationship - one of trust and honesty.

## My Role

My role as a Software Team Lead includes the following:
* Attract, retain, and develop passionate engineers
* Cultivate an environment of passion and innovation to help team members thrive
* Collect and distribute useful information
* Develop fun, useful products

## Communication

My job is to serve you, not the other way around. Very few things are more important than talking with you. My calendar might be full of meetings and it may be intimidating to schedule time with me, but **if you want to talk with me, let’s talk**. If you see an opening on my calendar, please schedule something (no need to ask first). If there is an urgent need, send me a message or knock on my door, and I will make time.

My hierarchy of communication preferences is as follows:
1. In-the-flesh conversations
1. Video calls
1. Audio calls
1. *Messaging
1. *Email

> *There is *some* benefit in text-based communications with regard to tracking/search-ability purposes.

**I value quick response times.** I will try to provide a response as quickly as I can, or I will let you know that I need more time to get you a response. I expect the same from you.

#### AVAILABILITY

A healthy work/life balance is very important to me. I typically work weekdays from 7:30am to 5pm and avoid working on weekends. I might occasionally work outside of these hours but only if the situation requires it. I don’t expect you to work any unusual hours either. You should never feel pressured to work more than a standard 40hr work week.

I try my best to leave work at work, and I would advise you do the same. I don’t expect to communicate with you outside of normal office hours, however, you can always message me 24/7. I have *Do Not Disturb* mode enabled when needed, so don’t feel like you are bothering me. I will respond only when it is convenient. The reverse applies as well. I might message you outside of typical office hours, but I don’t expect a response until it is convenient for you. 

I will always give notice prior to any irregular office outages (e.g. working from home, leaving early). I expect you to do the same. A flexible work schedule is important to me, but it’s also important not to abuse it. There is value in an office environment and working face-to-face with teammates.

#### FEEDBACK

I have aspirations of continually becoming a better human. I have just as much to learn from you, as you have to learn from me. Your feedback is appreciated and encouraged. There are three main criteria required to develop an environment of continued feedback. If I do something that goes against these criteria, please tell me ASAP.

1. High Safety -> no fear of retaliation 
1. Low Effort -> easy to give, no rebuttals
1. High Benefit -> positive results

I find the situation/behavior/impact model to be most effective in ensuring specific feedback. 

>Example: *When our team fails to hit a project deadline (situation), you consistently put yourself before the team and avoid placing the blame on any specific team member (behavior). This helps foster an environment of trust and make the entire team work harder (impact).*

I am a firm believer that positive feedback is more powerful than negative feedback. Please don’t forget to tell people what they are doing *right*.

#### RELATIONSHIPS

I hope to develop a great working relationship with you, and I encourage you to have great working relationships with your co-workers. Get to know those outside of our team to get a sense of how things work outside of our team. I’m more than happy to make introductions or help facilitate conversations with others in the company. 

## Guiding Principles

#### PEOPLE ARE MOST IMPORTANT

I care about the company because it affects the livelihood of its customers and employees. Our job is **not** to create a product. Our job is to impact people in the most beneficial way possible. This starts with customers and extends to your fellow employees. Treat people with respect and make decisions that provide the greatest impact.

On a related note, I believe in people over process. We should adapt our processes to work for our team members, not the other way around. At the end of the day, I value transparency and honest evaluation of what works and what doesn’t

#### THE FOCUS IS ON QUALITY

Our team will have a bigger impact by doing less, and doing it better. We want to develop a reputation of excellence. Everything we release should have our stamp of approval. Since we have limited time, we should ensure we are working on projects that are important.

#### START WITH "WHY?"

Following Simon Sinek's advice in [Start With Why?](https://www.amazon.com/Start-Why-Leaders-Inspire-Everyone/dp/1591846447), understanding the purpose (or WHY) behind your work is of the utmost importance. We should always put the purpose of what we are doing before the process (HOW we are building it) and the product (WHAT we are building). Clearly understanding our purpose and being able to articulate it to others will help you make better, more informed decisions while inspiring those around you. If at any time, your WHY is unclear, ask! If no one has an answer, maybe we should be working on something else instead.

## Meetings

I believe developers are most effective when given long periods of uninterrupted time to work. Because of this, I try to ensure any scheduled meetings have a purpose and stay on topic.

### ONE-ON-ONE’S

This is a regularly scheduled meeting to ask for feedback, bring up issues, or suggest improvements. These meetings are 100% for you. I will ask that you come prepared with agenda items that *you* want to talk about. I typically prepare topics and feedback of my own to help drive conversations. My main objective is for us to establish a relationship of trust so we can confidently have occasional, difficult conversations with one another.

If I cannot make our regularly scheduled meeting, I will always try to reschedule instead of cancel. I expect the same in return.

### GROUP MEETINGS

Steve Job compares employee interactions to that of a rock polisher. All of our day-to-day interactions help each other become better, more polished versions of ourselves. For that reason, I do find value in occasional group meetings. However, a successful meeting is one that:

1. Has a clear agenda and purpose, which is communicated ahead of time.
1. Has a leader who will stick to said agenda.
1. Ends with an accomplished goal, or is rescheduled if the goal was not met in the time allocated.
1. Action items are recorded.
